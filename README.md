The game is a simple version where there are six letters in all, from A to F.
The correct code has four letters and you need to guess them.
In this simple version the correct code has 4 and only 4 letters that are all different.
You get a black when color and position is right, and a white when only the position is right.
The game ends when you have found the right code, and then you can start a new game or just press escape.

NB: You need to have the library combinat installed before running the game.
